# day-planner
Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
Using Moment.js I displayed the current time and date on top of the calendar.
When the planner is opened there are time blocks from 9 am to 5 pm for the current day.
The user can also input data for any given time block, and when the save button is clicked the event will be saved to local storage. The event will be saved even when the page is refreshed.
